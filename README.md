[15 p] Lab 9: Angular, Spring, JPA
work individually; accept the following assignment: https://classroom.github.com/a/1c6tCYRR
convert the previous project to a web application using Angular
use Angular version 2 or higher (AngularJS/Angular1 is forbidden)
use Spring --- xml config forbidden
use Spring Data JPA (Hibernate) --- xml config forbidden
log messages using SLF4J
only one feature is enough, e.g., show list of students
Spring Boot is (for now) forbidden


[15 p] Lab 10: Angular, Spring, JPA
continue to work individually on the previous project (same repo)
Spring Boot is, from now on, allowed (the project structure should be the same as before i.e. core, web)
CRUD operations (the link entity/entities e.g. Rental, StudentDiscipline is/are for now not required; relations - for now, not required)
Filter, sort operations (client-side and server-side; on server-side, with Spring Data JPA)
Use both reactive and template-driven forms and validate user input (self study)
Use ES6 features (or above) and follow redux principles (see readme)
There should be four root entities and the requirements may be split over them, e.g., CRUD operations on entity1, client-side filters on entity2, server-side filters on entity3 etc


[15 p] Lab 11: Angular, Spring, JPA - mapping relationships
continue to work individually on the previous project (same repo)
Implement relationships between entities; the fetch type will be eager 
There should be at least four root entities and one repository per root aggregate; there should be no repository for the link entities (e.g. StudentDiscipline); there should be at least one relationship from each of the following: many-to-many, one-to-many, one-to-one (many-to-many may be implemented with two one-to-many associations; one-to-one may be implemented with embeddable)
Operations on the link entity (e.g. enroll students to disciplines, assign/view/etc grades); reports/statistics
